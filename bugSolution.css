To fix the `calc()` function issues, ensure that:

1. **Unit Consistency:**  Maintain consistent units within each `calc()` expression. Don't mix pixels with percentages or ems without proper conversion.
2. **Correct Nesting:** Avoid overly complex nesting of `calc()` functions.  Break down complex calculations into simpler, more manageable expressions.  If you have nested `calc()` expressions, make sure the order of operations is clear and correct.  
3. **Proper Parentheses:** Double check that opening and closing parentheses match correctly in nested expressions. Missing or misplaced parentheses can easily lead to calculation errors.

Example of a corrected `calc()` expression:

```css
/* Correct: Consistent units (px) and proper nesting */
width: calc(100px + 20px); /* 120px */
height: calc(50% - 10px);
```

Example of an incorrect `calc()` expression and its correction:
```css
/* Incorrect: Mixing units without conversion and improper nesting */
width: calc(calc(50% + 100px) + 2em); /* Error prone */

/* Correct: Consistent units (using px equivalent of 2em) and simplified expression */
width: calc((50% + 100px) + 32px); /* Assuming 2em is approximately 32px */
```
