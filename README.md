This repository demonstrates a common issue with the CSS `calc()` function: unexpected results from incorrect nesting or inconsistent unit usage. The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides a corrected version.  The issue arises from how the browser parses and evaluates nested `calc()` expressions and the handling of different unit types within those expressions. Ensuring correct syntax and unit consistency is crucial for reliable results.
